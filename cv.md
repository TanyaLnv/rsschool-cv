## About me

I'm looking to develop my programming skills. I like to be inspired by incredible work on creating the visual component of websites. However, I donâ€™t want to limit myself to front-end, because creating a whole product is much more beautiful. 

### What am I like?

* calm
* eager
* friendly  
* sociable  
* responsible
* hard-working

I believe that we create our own life.
